# Data-Analysis-with-R

The second project for my Intermediate Applied Data Analysis class from the MscBMI Program at The University of Chicago focused deeply on Data Analysis in R. The code for this repository elaborates on the specific code used to answer questions on basic plotting, odds/odds-ratio, study design and table 1 creation (an essential in any research paper/study!).

1. Basic plotting included box-plot between two variables and making observations from the plots in relation to the dataset(s). 

2. Along with calculating the odds/odds-ratio values, the section explored identifying primary exposure & outcome of interest along with a 2X2 table against both variables. 

3. In the Study Design section I designed several studies, particuarly case-control, retrospective and prospective, that 
allowed for hypothesis testing along with identification of inclusion and exclusion criteria for each. 

4. Table 1 creation of a dataset involved formatting certain continuous variables to categorical, filtering based on certain variables, deducing mean & standard deviation for each case and deducing P-values for accurate confidence intervals.
